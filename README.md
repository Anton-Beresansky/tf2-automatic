**tf2-automatic** is a bot inspired by the [bptf-automatic](https://bitbucket.org/jessecar/backpack.tf-automatic) project. The bot is available under the MIT license, anyone can downloaded and modify it, though you can't run it without having access to the [TF2 Automatic API](https://api.tf2automatic.com).

Before you install the bot, there are a few things you need to have taken care off before you will be able to run the bot.
* Have an alt account that you can use, you must know the secrets of it. I suggest using the [Steam Desktop Authenticator](https://github.com/Jessecar96/SteamDesktopAuthenticator) to authenticate the account with, and get the secrets. The account can't be limited, you can check if it is limited by going to this link through the alt: https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=3330-IAGK-7663
* You need access to our API, you get that by contacting Nicklason, you can do that through the [Discord server](https://tf2automatic.com/discord).
* NodeJS version 6 or more
